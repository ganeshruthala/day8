<h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
<textarea cols="100" rows="23">
    No, terms and conditions agreements aren’t legally required, but it’s in your best interest to post one on your website or mobile app.

Not only is this standard practice across the world, but it also provides your site with an additional layer of legal protection.

While it’s not guaranteed to hold up in a court of law, in the event of a dispute, arbitrators may consider multiple facets of your T&C document to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

Plus, according to the American Bar Association (ABA), some specific legal disclosures apply to certain types of transactions, which must be made as written statements that may apply to your business.

Those details belong as clauses in your terms and conditions agreement, like stipulations outlined by the following federal US laws:

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
Terms and conditions may not be legally required, but privacy policies and cookie policies are.
